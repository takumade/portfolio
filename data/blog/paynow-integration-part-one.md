Wassup everybody, how are you doing , in this coming series of tutorials I am going to teach you how to integrate PayNow into your web app or website.

## Present Day
In Zimbabwe its difficult to get access to a fully blown PayPal account likely due to sanctions (though PayPal denies the allegations) so you can only spend but you cannot receive. Which is a total rip off to entrepreneurs.....

## So what's PayNow

PayNow is an online payment processing platform for Zimbabwe which allows you to make different kinds of payments from tax, fees, bills, subscriptions, donations, payouts etc.
